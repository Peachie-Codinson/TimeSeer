# Private Academic Planner

A lightweight single-user academic planner: server-authoritative modular monolith on SQLite,
with a combined calendar/task dashboard. See the full technical specification for the target
architecture across all phases.

## Status

This repository currently implements **Stage 1: Foundation**:

- pnpm workspace (`apps/server`, `apps/web`)
- Hono API server on Node, with `/api/v1/health/live` and `/api/v1/health/ready`
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3` + Drizzle ORM, with the core schema (owners, sessions, areas,
  tasks, events, work sessions, quotas, archive, scheduled jobs) and WAL pragmas configured
- React + Vite web app, served by the Node app in production, using the Hono RPC client for
  typed API calls and TanStack Query for server state
- Docker Compose (`app` + `caddy`) and a Caddyfile for TLS termination
- A `bootstrap.sh` script to build and start the stack

Not yet implemented: authentication, the combined dashboard, task board, calendar UX, work
sessions, archive flushing, quotas, the scheduling engine, notifications, the Tauri desktop
shell, and the Canvas integration stub. These land in later stages.

## Development

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install

# Run the API server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm dev:server

# Run the web app (http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to :3000)
pnpm dev:web
```

### Database

```bash
# Generate a migration from schema.ts changes
pnpm db:generate

# Apply pending migrations
pnpm db:migrate
```

The SQLite database is written to `DATABASE_PATH` (defaults to `./data/planner.db` locally,
`/data/planner.db` in the container).

## Deployment

```bash
./infrastructure/scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

Builds and starts the `app` and `caddy` containers via Docker Compose. All persistent state
lives in the `planner_data` volume (SQLite database + attachments).
